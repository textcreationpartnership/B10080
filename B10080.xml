            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT I Yeſterday gave you in words, as few as I could, upon your mention of ſome Cenſures vulgarly paſs'd upon me; I think fit to repeat to you now at a little more leiſure in Writing, which is not ſo ſubject to be miſtaken; that is, according to what you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly deſir'd, a true and plain Declaration of my Principles and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, in reſpect to the Differences between the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the preſent Church of <hi>England,</hi> conſtituted by Act of Parliament. It was to this Effect: 1. That I had ſome years ſince agreed with ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtians to enter into a <hi>Religious Society</hi> upon three Principles, whereof one was to follow the <hi>Example of the Antient Chriſtians</hi> as near as we could. 2. That the Antient Chriſtians are to be conſider'd not as Perſons of ſome Sect; but as Members of <hi>One Great Body</hi> of Perſons ſelected out of all Nations, and united and formed into <hi>a well conſtituted Society,</hi> under a Spiritual Regiment or Theocraſy, and ſubject to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders thereof. 3. That as the <hi>Nation of the Jews</hi> continued the <hi>Peculiar People of God,</hi> notwithſtanding all their Corruptions; ſo that our Saviour and his Apoſtles continued Communion with them till by the Judgment of God their Polity and City were deſtroyed, and this Society and one Body of Chriſtians were formed and ſucceeded in that Priviledge: So this great Society of Chriſtians, called <hi>One Holy Catholick Church,</hi> and all the particular Churches, whereof it is Compoſed, continue <hi>the Church of Chriſt,</hi> and Parts of that Catholick Church; notwithſtanding as great Corruptions as thoſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> unleſs any of them be juſtly cut off, or unjuſtly ſeparate themſelves from the Unity of that One Body, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Example of our Saviour himſelf, and his Apoſtles after him, till by the like Judgment of God any of them be deſtroyed, (as ſome have been) or the Time of the Gentiles be fulfilled. 4. That ſuch <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from the Unity of this One Body, called <hi>Schiſm,</hi> is a great Sin, and agreed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f <hi>Rome</hi> very juſtly caſt out; but yet that that was done with ſo
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:192032:2"/>much injuſtice in other reſpects, Sacriledge, and pernicious Hereſy, and by an incompetent Authority in other Matters, as inſtead of Reformation made an undeniable <hi>Schiſmatical Separation:</hi> and the Nation is to this day under <hi>Excommunication</hi> for juſt Cauſe, by Competent Authority, and hath no proper Eccleſiaſtical Communion with any part of the Catholick Church. 6. That to extricate my ſelf out of all this Guilt and Miſchief, I have, according to antient Uſage, drawn up a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Faith,</hi> with a <hi>Renunciation</hi> of all the Sacrilege, Hereſy, and Schiſm of this Church, and <hi>Declaration</hi> of my deſire of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the whole Catholick Church, and all truly Catholick Churches, as there may be occaſion; and made a particular offer of it to the two Roman Catholick Biſhops, who were then here in Town. But they were tied up, and could not admit me upon other Terms than thoſe of <hi>Pius</hi> 4, and to thoſe I could not ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p>And this is <hi>my Caſe</hi> at this time: Singular in ſome reſpects I confeſs it is, and ſuch as is no ones beſides, that I know of, except thoſe who are in Communion with me; but ſuch as I would not change with any one till I be better informed, being well ſatisfied, that I have been conducted into it by unforeſeen ſteps by a Gracious Providence over me, much more than by any Humane Prudence of my own, and that I have theſe conſiderable <hi>Advantages</hi> by it. 1. That I am virtually in the moſt <hi>Catholick Communion</hi> that can be, by my Publick Declaration, and ſpecial Offers and Requeſt; though I cannot actually Communicate with any for want of Opportunity at preſent. For if I be unjuſtly kept out, my Caſe is no worſe than if I were unjuſtly caſt out; and my Renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation of the Sacrilege, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all that I can, or am concern'd to do. 2. That all, who Communicate with me, are <hi>Partakers</hi> in the ſame Advantage; which no others are, except they do as I have done, or Communicate with ſuch as have done ſo. 3. That as to Matters of <hi>Faith and Doctrine,</hi> there is not any Point wherein I differ from this Church of <hi>England;</hi> but I have the whole Catholick Church, Eaſt and Weſt, and all Antiquity on my ſide; as in that of Prayers for the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor any, wherein I differ from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but I have all the reſt, and all the Proteſtants beſides, if not ſome of them too. 4. That as to Matters of <hi>Practice in Worſhip and Diſcipline;</hi> there is nothing that I do, which either the Greek or Latin, or any Catholick Church, or this of <hi>England,</hi> do or can diſallow upon any truly Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Principle. 5. That as to the <hi>Government</hi> there is nothing in my No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but what is approved by moſt Learned Men of all theſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and if I live not under ſuch a Government; 'tis my Unhappineſs, not my Fault.</p>
            <p>As for my not Communicating with the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> actually, it is for ſuch Reaſons, as not only all Proteſtants, but all Churches in the World but themſelves; that is, all Catholicks but Roman Catholicks (which is a factious diſtinction) do allow. Yet I acknowledge the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence of the Biſhop and Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and by the Grace of God
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:192032:2"/>will aſſert and maintain that, and whatever is truly Catholick amongſt them: But the Corruptions and Uſurpations of the Papacy, and all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery I utterly diſown and deteſt, as Injurious and Scandalous to the moſt Holy Chriſtian Religion; and heartily deſire the Reformation of that, but without the Deſtruction of the Church, or leaſt diminution of the juſt Rights or Authority thereof.</p>
            <p>And for my not Communicating with this preſent <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at preſent, it is, 1. For ſuch Reaſons as all Catholicks in the World approve as juſt and neceſſary: 2. It is not as an Adverſary, but as a Friend; but firſt as the Servant of God, to bear my Teſtimony to the Truths of Chriſtianity, againſt their Corruptions and Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which I have briefly noted in my Profeſſion of Faith, and other Writings in Print: And ſecondly, by way of Admonition to them, that they may be moved to remove the Cauſes of all our Diſſenſions, and of the <hi>Secret Curſe</hi> that is upon it, that it may become a Glorious Church indeed. And that you may not think, as you are very apt to do, that I am too blunt, and uſe hard words without ſufficient Cauſe; I will give you an inſtance or two of what I here ſay.</p>
            <p>The Corruption of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> by <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and his Schiſmatical impoſing it upon the Church by Parliamentary Authority without the Conſent of the Clergy, is undeniable matter of fact: And it is as certain, that there ſoon followed the Deſtruction of all the known Actors in it, and principal Promoters in Parliament; and it ſelf was firſt caſt out here, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately became a Curſe, and a Bone of Diſſention among the Exiles at <hi>Frankford;</hi> and after there return, and ſo continued till our late Civil Wars, when it was a ſecond time caſt out; and when reſtored again, again proved the ſame, and hath ſo continued to this day. And if this were not enough for Confirmation of it, I could ſhew you as manifeſt Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Subtilty of Satan in the Corruptions of it, as theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, but that it would be too long for this place. But one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more I here give you; and that is ſo groſs Abomination, that their Minds muſt be darkned that do not perceive it: It is the expoſing of what is moſt Sacred, the Holy <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to the greateſt Prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath been known in any Chriſtian Church, except by ſome Schiſmaticks; upon whom the Dogs, to which they threw it, became Inſtruments of Vengeance for their Impiety. It is one of the great matters of Shame in this Church, that there is nothing of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Diſcipline in it; nor can be, unleſs they had ſuch Apoſtolick Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits as would obey God rather than Man. And it is another, that they no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> only want means to keep Dogs from the Altar, but they are even called to it, contrary their own Inclination; (by <hi>the Teſt,</hi>) and they themſelves dare not but deliver the Sacred Elements to them. And all this is but the Effect of their <hi>Eraſtian</hi> or <hi>Cranmerian</hi> Hereſy; their precedent Betraying the Rights of Chriſt's Church to Slavery, under th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Uſurped Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Man. And if all this together be conſidered, how much ſhort it is of Worſhipping the Beaſt, Sacrificing to Heathen Gods, and what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:192032:3"/>was done by thoſe called <hi>Traditores</hi> of old, I leave it to you to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
            <p>If it be well conſider'd how much of the genuine Chriſtianity, and of the Eſſential or Neceſſary parts thereof, are already ſuppreſs'd under pretence of Reformation, or otherwiſe loſt in this Nation, and how much more is going apace after; it may be perceived that there is no little need of another kind of <hi>Reformation</hi> than that External ſuperficial one of Manners by human Laws, leſt while we are wholly intent upon that as a mighty Matter; that which is the true Fountain of all real vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue be neglected, and expoſed to the ſubtle Machination of ſuch as but laugh at all that work, and are endeavouring to undermine and ſubvert all from the Foundation; nay perhaps be willing to joyn in the One, that they may with the more Advantage effectually deſtroy the other. Mr. <hi>Toland</hi>'s Club behave themſelves at their Meetings as ſoberly as any, and conſult with as much earneſtneſs and deſire of effecting what they aim at. But thoſe who ſhould be the firſt Movers, and moſt Zealous Promoters of all good; are the Betrayers of all by their Lazineſs and Baſeneſs, and the Original of the growth of all our Evil, by their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs both to God and Man; nay, the Principal Occaſion of the growth of Atheiſm, Deiſm, and Apoſtacy, by the Scandal of their Greedineſs of Preferments in this World, and Unconcernedneſs for any thing elſe.</p>
            <p>This is what I think may ſatisfy you, and furniſh you with Matter to ſatisfy others, concerning my Actions and Principles; but poſſibly may give you ſome Diſſatisfaction in other reſpects: But if withal it do but open the way to a more ſound Satisfaction, the Trouble will be but like that of a Purge or Vomit, which, by cleanſing the Body of what was hurtful, prepares it to receive and digeſt ſound Nouriſhment the better. And ſuch I wiſh you may find it.</p>
